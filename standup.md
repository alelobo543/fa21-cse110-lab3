What did I work on yesterday? I played sudoku all day. Could only beat 1 easy puzzle though it was hard.

What am I working on today? Trying to get through a medium puzzle, but I am not making much progress.

What are issues are blocking me today? Everything is too difficult. Can't wrap my head around these numbers.
